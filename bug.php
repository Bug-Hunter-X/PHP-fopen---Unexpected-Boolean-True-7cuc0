```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
}
```
This code has a potential issue.  If `fopen()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist, insufficient permissions), it returns `false`.  The following `if` statement checks for a boolean true value. However, if the file pointer is successfully opened, `fopen()` can return a resource ID (typically an integer)  which PHP considers TRUE in the conditional. Therefore, error handling won't always function as expected.
